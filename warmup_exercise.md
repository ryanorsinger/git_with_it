# Git Warmup

1. Make a new repository on github called "now_i_know" or "my_data_science_notes"
- copy the SSH clone address
2. `cd ~/codeup-data-science` 
3. Clone your new repo with 
`git clone ` then paste that git clone address
4. `cd now_i_know` and do:
	- `git status` to double check that this is a repo
	- `git remote -v` to show the remotes
5. Move your `today_i_learned.txt` document that you made earlier this morning (or right now..)
6. `git add` the new file
7. `git commit` this new work
8. `git push` to push this work
- Oh btw: if you ever get a message about "there's no remote setup" and then the message gives you the code to push and set up the remote, copy + paste that code snippet

## Now what?
- Every day, when you learn something new like a new shortcut, command, function, or key concept, add to your `today_i_learned.txt` file, then add, commit, and push your work.
